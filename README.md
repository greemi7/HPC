In light of all the hype with AI HPC (High Performance Computing) is getting a lot of attention of late.

I would like to walk through the process of building a simple HPC cluster and then fill in the blanks as to where high speed I/O, ML and AI would fit into the design as expansions.
There is no need to make this overly complex like many of the engineers who want to keep their jobs would like to do. Think about legalese and medical short-hand as examples of how the professionals in those professions tend to make things overly complicated as to justify their existence.

First, I would like to lay out my plan for building a small Raspberry Pi (R-Pi for short) cluster. Currently I have 3 Raspberry Pi 4's and one R-Pi 3.
